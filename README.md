# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

# Monster Ternary Operator Challenge

This repository contains a series of JavaScript challenges focusing on using ternary operators to make concise conditional logic decisions. The challenges simulate various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks, where ternary operators are used to determine different outcomes based on given conditions.

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
Given a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink, print whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

### Challenge 2: Stock Check
Track the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. Use a ternary operator to print "Time to restock!" if the number is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number is 5 or more.

### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, use a ternary operator to print "Chilled to perfection!" if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour. If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!", otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

Feel free to modify the provided code or add your own additional challenges to further practice using ternary operators in JavaScript.
